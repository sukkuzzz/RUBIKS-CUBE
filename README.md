**Overview**
The Rubik's Cube Solver is a project aimed at simulating and solving a Rubik's Cube using various search algorithms, including BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and IDDFS (Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search). This project demonstrates the implementation of these algorithms in solving one of the most iconic combinatorial puzzles.

**Features**
Cube Simulation: A virtual Rubik's Cube with customizable moves.
Solver Algorithms:
BFS: Ensures the shortest solution path is found.
DFS: Explores deeper solutions, albeit less optimal.
IDDFS: Combines depth-first search's space efficiency with breadth-first search's completeness.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate the efficiency of each algorithm in solving the cube.
